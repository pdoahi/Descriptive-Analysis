# Exploratory Data Analysis
In this notebook, we analyzed over ten thousand apps from the Google Play Store. We can use our findings to inform our decisions should we ever wish to create an app ourselves.

Let's take a look at the data, which consists of two files:

apps.csv: contains all the details of the applications on Google Play. There are 13 features that describe a given app.

user_reviews.csv: contains 100 reviews for each app, most helpful first. The text in each review has been pre-processed and attributed with three new features: Sentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.
